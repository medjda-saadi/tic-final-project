        <p class="ttic">
            <b>Information and Communication Technologies (TIC)</b> are all the digital tools and systems
            that help people communicate, share information, and manage it efficiently.
            They include computers, the internet, software, smart applications, 
            and other digital devices.
            These technologies play an essential role in daily life, whether in education,
            work, or entertainment.  <br> TIC facilitate the exchange of information between
            individuals and organizations and improve communication in various fields.
            They also contribute to increasing productivity, saving time, and providing 
            fast and accurate access to information.
            By using TIC, students and teachers can communicate more effectively,
            employees can exchange data easily, and organizations can manage their
            operations more efficiently. As a result, Information and Communication 
            Technologies have become essential for societies aiming for development and progress in the digital age.
            To make TIC effective in real-life applications, several technological tools
            and platforms are used. These tools support communication, collaboration, data management, and digital content creation.
            Among the most widely used TIC tools today are Google services, Microsoft tools, 
            version control systems such as Git and GitHub, as well as web technologies like HTML and CSS.

        <h1>5. Web Technologies: HTML and CSS</h1>
        <img src="images/web.jpg" class="img">
        <p class="we">The Web is one of the most important components of Information and
             Communication Technologies (TIC). It allows users to access, share, and publish 
             information globally through the internet. Websites and web applications have become
              essential tools for communication, education, business, and digital services.
              To create and display content on the web, specific technologies are used, 
              among which HTML and CSS are fundamental.<br>
              <ol><li class="li">HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
                HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. 
                It defines the content of a website, such as text, images, links, tables, and forms.
                HTML uses elements and tags to organize information in a clear and logical way. 
                It allows browsers to understand and display content correctly.
                 Without HTML, web pages would not have a structured format.
                 In the context of TIC, HTML plays a key role in information presentation and 
                 content organization on the web. It enables the creation and sharing of digital 
                 information accessible to users worldwide.
                 <li class="li">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
                 CSS is a style sheet language used to control the appearance and design of web pages.
                  It is responsible for the visual presentation of content, including colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness.
                 CSS improves the user experience by making websites more attractive and readable.
                  It also allows developers to separate content from design, which makes websites easier to maintain and update.
                  As a TIC technology, CSS supports effective communication by enhancing
                 the visual clarity and accessibility of information on the web.
                 <li class="li">Relation between Web, HTML, and CSS in TIC</li>
                 The web relies on HTML to structure information and on CSS to design and present 
                 it visually. Together, they form the foundation of modern websites and web 
                 applications. These technologies support TIC by enabling digital communication,
                  information sharing, and online services.
                  <li class="li">Conclusion</li>
                  In conclusion, the web, HTML, and CSS are essential technologies within TIC.
                   They allow the creation of structured, well-designed, and accessible digital
                    content, contributing significantly to communication and information exchange in the digital age.

        <p>
          <ol> <li class="li">LaTeX</li> document preparation system widely used in academia, research, and technical 
          fields. It is considered a part of <b>Information and Communication Technologies (TIC)</b>
           because it helps in creating, organizing, and sharing structured digital information in a
         professional way.<br>
          LaTeX is mainly used for writing scientific documents such as reports, articles, theses,
           and books. It allows users to focus on the content while the system automatically manages
            the layout, formatting, and structure of the document.<br>
          One of the main advantages of LaTeX is its ability to handle complex documents that 
          include mathematical formulas, tables, figures, references, and bibliographies.
           This makes it especially useful in fields such as computer science, mathematics, 
           engineering, and physics.<br> 
           In the context of TIC, LaTeX contributes to information management and communication 
           by enabling the production of high-quality and well-structured documents.
            It also supports collaboration, as documents can be easily shared and edited using 
            version control systems. <br>
            <li class="li">Relation between LaTeX and TIC</li>
            LaTeX supports TIC by improving the clarity, accuracy, and presentation of information.
            It helps researchers, students, and professionals communicate complex ideas effectively
             through well-formatted digital documents.
             <li class="li">Conclusion</li>
             In conclusion, LaTeX is an important TIC tool for academic and technical communication.
              Its precision, reliability, and professional output make it a valuable technology for
               information creation and sharing in the digital age.
